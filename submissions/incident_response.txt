1. Incident commander name:
Ravshan Kh

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three crypto mining pods of unknown source were launched on the RKE cluster.The crypto miners were identified as  minergate, moneropool and cryptotonight.

3. Summary of what was affected:
Malicious users were able to break into our kubernetes cluster and launch crypto mining containers. They wanted to benefit by consuming our server resources for their own
benefit of mining cryptocurrencies.

4. Summmry of the impact:
As a result of the hack, the amount of calls to the Kubectl API increased, CPU Utilization rose to 99% and the memory was getting overloaded. 
The system became unstable, irresponsive and laggy.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
Suspicious increase in the consumption of the server resources were noticed through Kubernetes Compute Resources in Grafana.
Also, the falco exporter noticed 3 calls to the kube api for scheduling new crypto pods. As a result, 3 unknown crypto mining
pods were identified and deleted from the cluster in the timely manner.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
Kubernetes cluster is not secure by default. We should investigate further to find out the security weakness in our cluster and harden it. 
We should deply investigate the access origin to our Kube API server. Also, we should discourage unknown containers from running on our clusters using
admission controllers.
