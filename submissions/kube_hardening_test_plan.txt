How will you test the changes?
We will have a non-production environment to test our changes. A full copy of the production environment will be installed on our test cluster to make sure the 
setup and environment doesn't differ. If our tests are good we can try directing a small traffic to our non-production environment to see if everything is working well.
We will also run Grafana and Prometheus here as well to track how the system  is performing after the changes were done. We will monitor Falco events as well as the
overall system CPU/memory load as well as any request response time changes.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
First of all, we are going to test the changes in the non-production environment as stated above. Secondly, we will do some canary testing with small traffic as well.
Thirdly, if it all goes well, only then we will deploy changes to the production environment. We will monitor the system performance using Prometheus and Grafana.
Finally, we are going to use git to version control our cluster.yml file changes so if anything goes wrong we can revert the file. We'll need a reboot though.
